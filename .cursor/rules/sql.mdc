# SQL Schema Management

Always remind me to update the [create-all-tables.sql](mdc:create-all-tables.sql) file whenever any database table is modified, deleted, or created. This is critical for maintaining schema consistency across environments.

When modifying database schemas or entity models, remember to:
1. Check if the change affects the database structure
2. If yes, ensure that create-all-tables.sql is updated accordingly
3. Maintain consistent naming conventions and data types

This reminder is a project-wide priority to ensure database integrity.
